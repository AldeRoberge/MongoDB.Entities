# Welcome

This library simplifies access to mongodb by abstracting away the C# mongodb driver and providing some additional features on top of it. The API is clean and intuitive resulting in less lines of code that is more readable/ human friendly than driver code.

# Advantages
- Don't have to deal with `ObjectIds`, `BsonDocuments` & magic strings unless you want to.
- Built-in support for `One-To-One`, `One-To-Many` and `Many-To-Many` relationships.
- Async only API for scalable application development.
- Query data using LINQ, lambda expressions, filters and aggregation pipelines.
- Sorting, paging and projecting is made convenient.
- Simple data migration framework similar to EntityFramework.
- Programatically define indexes.
- Full text search (including fuzzy matching) with text indexes.
- Multi-document transaction support.
- Multiple database support.
- Easy bulk operations.
- Easy Change-stream support.
- GeoSpatial search.
- Stream files in chunks to and from mongodb (GridFS alternative).
- Project types supported: .Net Standard 2.0 (.Net Core 2.0 & .Net Framework 4.6.1 or higher)
